A parser implementation for the C- programming language using JFlex and CUP

This project was made from building off the files provied in C1-Package.tgz

to build the program:
    make

to clean the directory (including deleting .abs files):
    make clean

to run the program with AST output:
    java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main filename.cm -a
        -where "/usr/share/java/cup.jar" is replaces with your filepath to cup.jar
        -and "filename.cm" is replaces with the name of the C- file you want to build from
    A file called "filename.abs" will be created with the output

to run the program without AST output:
    java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. Main filename.cm
        -where "/usr/share/java/cup.jar" is replaces with your filepath to cup.jar
        -and "filename.cm" is replaces with the name of the C- file you want to build from
